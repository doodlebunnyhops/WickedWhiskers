# To Do
- [ ] CoolDowns
- [x] What are the ways players can join the game?
  - ~~logic i have `opt in/out` isn't flushed out and idk how much i care for it.~~
  - either through /join or react join
- [x] Better command descriptions
- [ ] Consider easier to read command names
- [ ] LOG...how have i not put this in yet..
- [x] Update the help cmd
- [ ] make sure we're salting inputs... be safe not dumb
- [ ] decide on where messages should be sent:
  - admin channel
  - event channel
  - ephemeral response or not? <- if not it will post it what ever channel invoked in.
- [ ] Make some responses prettier with embeds
- [ ] Include Candy Stolen and Candy Won from Cauldron Spell in /stats
- [ ] Cauldron has a chance of exploding it takes away a blast of players candy and gives it to one random player

# Found Bugs
- [x] lottery system..it's wrong
  - DB isn't tracking how many tickets a player has, thus not giving players increased chances of winning
  - But i do like the idea of a moderator or admin coming in and deciding to be evil and give it to one or distributed random player(s) who may not have purchased a ticket ðŸ˜ˆ muwahahaha...
- [x] Make sure tickets_purchased removes tickets after the cauldron draw has occurred!!
- [x] Show in stats how many tickets you have
- [x] /trick command sends "The application did not respond." I need to respond with interaction ephemeral true with timeout and then a post_event_channel() to stop this
- [x] Give 0 candy should not be possible OR should itâ€¦ with a smart butt remark
- [x] Stealing from someone who has 0 candy...that meany LOL
  - Give some to the target
    - Put the rest in the cauldron
  - Put all in the cauldron
  - Give all to the target
