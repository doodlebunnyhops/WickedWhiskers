# WickedWhiskers

There are a lot of commands that haven't been implemented yet! If you're looking to contribute there's plenty to do here :D and then enjoy the discord bot game! 

Hacktoberfest 2024 is ON!

## What is WickedWhiskers

This is a discord bot that enabls players in your server to interact in a halloween themed game.  `/trick` members out of their candy or `/treat` them with some?

Buy Potions to place candy into a cauldron with a chance to win buckets of candy! Be weery, the good witch Luna and bad witch Raven keep an eye on how you play! Ever so often (when a moderator feels like it really), one of the witches will be selected to cast the spell in the cauldron to select their winner(s)...but sometimes it doesn't go according to plan. _partially implmented_

Not paitent enough to wait on a cauldron event, no worries try your hand at pumpkin smashing! See if candy spills out or you got a dud with no candy :sad: _not implemented yet_
