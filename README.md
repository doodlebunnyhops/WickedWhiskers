# WickedWhiskers
a discord bot that plays trick-or-treat

Current state of code is not functional! I'm working on a revamp of decorators and stewing on a balanced version to use ram/cpu with sqlite and classes.

      - if  num_players is not set, it will default to Single Mode.

#### Server Management

- **game_invite**: Creates a message inviting players to join the game by reacting with a ðŸŽƒ.
  - The message will be posted in the channel the command was run
  - It's recommended that a channel be set up that allows only those who will run this command and the bot to post to it. This way, there is no clutter for users to react to and join.
