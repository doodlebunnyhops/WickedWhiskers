# Ideas for Moderators and Players

## 1. More Player Commands

### `/costume`
- **Action:** Players can choose a costume, which gives them a temporary bonus for a short period (e.g., higher chance to trick, more candy from treats).
- **Example:** `/costume vampire` → Equips the vampire costume, increasing trick success rate for 5 minutes.
- **Purpose:** Adds a fun cosmetic element with some gameplay benefits, allowing players to strategize with short-term boosts.

### `/trick_or_treat`
- **Action:** Players can go "trick-or-treating" at houses, with random outcomes: getting candy, losing candy, or encountering spooky events.
- **Example:** `/trick_or_treat haunted_house` → Visits the haunted house, resulting in either a reward or spooky consequence.
- **Purpose:** Adds an exploration and random chance element, encouraging players to take risks for potential rewards.

### `/curse_protection`
- **Action:** Allows players to protect themselves from curses or tricks for a limited time by using candy to cast a protection spell.
- **Example:** `/curse_protection` → Protects the player from any curses or tricks for the next 10 minutes.
- **Purpose:** Adds strategic defensive play, where players can avoid negative effects for a short period.

### `/candy_bank`
- **Action:** Players can deposit a portion of their candy into a bank where it is protected from being stolen or lost.
- **Example:** `/candy_bank 20` → Deposits 20 candies into the bank.
- **Purpose:** Adds an element of risk management, where players can safeguard part of their candy stash while still participating in riskier events like "smash_pumpkin."

## 2. More Moderator Commands

### `/random_event`
- **Action:** Initiates a random server-wide event. Examples include:
  - **Candy Storm**: Randomly gives players candy.
  - **Haunted House**: Temporarily traps a player in a "haunted house," preventing them from tricking or treating for a set time.
  - **Pumpkin Patch**: Players can gather candy for a limited time.
- **Example:** `/random_event Candy Storm` → A candy storm rains down, distributing candy to random players.
- **Purpose:** Adds surprise and engagement to the game, keeping players on their toes with random events.

### `/announce_event`
- **Action:** Sends a spooky announcement to the server about an upcoming event or change in gameplay rules.
- **Example:** `/announce_event "The cauldron is about to boil!"` → Sends a spooky announcement to let everyone know something big is coming.
- **Purpose:** Helps moderators manage events and create excitement by notifying players in advance.

### `/give_random_gift`
- **Action:** Moderators can give a surprise gift of candy or items to a random player in the game.
- **Example:** `/give_random_gift 50` → Randomly gives 50 pieces of candy to a player.
- **Purpose:** Adds an element of surprise, rewarding random active players and keeping them engaged.

### `/top_ghouls`
- **Action:** Displays the top-performing players who have accumulated the most candy, tricks, or other metrics.
- **Example:** `/top_ghouls` → Shows the leaderboard for players with the most candy.
- **Purpose:** Adds competitiveness and shows who the top players are in the game.

## 3. Event-Specific Commands

### `/spooky_gift`
- **Action:** Allows players to gift candy to another player as a spooky gift, which can either reward or curse the recipient.
- **Example:** `/spooky_gift @Player 10` → Gifts 10 pieces of candy, with a chance of a surprise effect (bonus candy, curse, etc.).
- **Purpose:** Adds an element of mystery to gifting, where players don’t always know what effect their gift will have.

### `/spooky_channels`
- **Action:** Assigns specific channels to have a spooky effect, like eerie sound effects or ghostly interactions during events.
- **Example:** `/spooky_channels #haunted_room` → Turns the channel into a spooky zone, where strange things happen.
- **Purpose:** Adds atmosphere to events by turning certain channels into haunted areas, enhancing immersion.

### `/set_crypt`
- **Action:** Sends a player to a "crypt," restricting their actions (similar to freezing) for a specific duration.
- **Example:** `/set_crypt @Player` → Sends the player to the crypt, limiting their activity for the next 10 minutes.
- **Purpose:** Adds more variety to player restrictions and adds depth to the punishment/timeout mechanic.

### `/set_lair`
- **Action:** Sends a player to the witch’s lair, where they are "held" until released.
- **Example:** `/set_lair @Player` → Sends the player to Raven’s lair, where they can’t act until a specific time.
- **Purpose:** Adds another thematic way to handle player restrictions during the game.
